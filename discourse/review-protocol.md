### Review Protocol

Scholarly feedback in The Pedagogy Lab adheres to collegial and evidence ‑based discourse. Reviewers should ground their critiques in relevant sources and clearly articulate the theoretical and practical stakes of the work under review. All critiques must cite relevant literature in either Chicago or APA format, using footnotes or parenthetical citations as appropriate.

When reviewing theoretical essays or design narratives, participants should aim to expand the conversation rather than dismiss contributions. Questions and counterpoints should be framed constructively, emphasising the relationship between theory and practice. Citations should follow standard referencing formats to facilitate scholarly dialogue.

Each essay or reflection in `/docs/` must include a link to a dedicated GitHub Discussion thread for commentary. Reviewers should contribute their thoughts within these threads to maintain a public record of scholarly discourse. Discussion should remain respectful and open to diverse perspectives.

On a quarterly basis, discourse outcomes – key themes, critiques, and unresolved questions – will be summarised in `/meta/reflection-journal.md`. This practice ensures that community feedback informs the ongoing development of the Pedagogy Lab’s curriculum and research agenda.
