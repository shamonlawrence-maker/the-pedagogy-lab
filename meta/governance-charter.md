### Governance Charter

The Pedagogy Lab commits to transparency, collaboration, attribution, and learner consent. All participants will abide by these principles in both the creation and dissemination of learning modules, essays, and other artifacts.

#### Ethical Commitments

- **Transparency:** Document and openly share the design process, reflections, and data-handling protocols.  
- **Collaboration:** Encourage co-creation and respect diverse perspectives in all modules and residencies.  
- **Attribution:** Credit all contributors, including human and AI agents, using clear authorship declarations.  
- **Learner Consent:** Obtain consent from any learners whose reflections or feedback may appear in the repository.

#### Authorship Conventions

Human authors and AI agents must be clearly identified in documentation and metadata. Major releases should append an authorship declaration template listing contributors and describing their roles.

#### Data-Handling Protocols

Classroom reflections or community feedback stored in this repository must be anonymized or pseudonymized unless explicit consent has been obtained. Sensitive data will not be shared publicly. The repository will adhere to data protection regulations and ethical guidelines.
